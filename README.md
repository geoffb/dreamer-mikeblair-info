# A Dreamer's World

This is an archive of my late father's personal homepage circa late 1990s.

His site was hosted on Tripod and, as of this writing, is accessible at the following URL:

http://members.tripod.com/~Raging_Tiger/

Since Tripod could go offline at any time, I wanted to make sure his homepage remained online.

In addition, Tripod has embedded more and more ads over the years, ruining the experience.

## Changes

I've attempted to make as few changes as possible in order to preserve his original HTML coding.

Redundant images and other assets have been pruned. Tripod's obtrusive ads and tracking JavaScript have been removed, of course.

Unsurprisingly, the web has moved forward in the last twenty years and so I've made minor styling and layout changes in order to keep his site rendering as I believe he would have intended.

This version of the website is statically hosted in AWS' S3. As such, I've added extra content, like `/error.html` to handle errors.

## External Links

Many of the external pages, webrings, counters, etc are no longer functioning. I've decided to leave these URLs intact for now.

At some point in the future, I would like to replace these broken links with the Internet Archive versions of these sites (if they exist).
